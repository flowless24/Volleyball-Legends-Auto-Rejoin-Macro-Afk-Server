Roblox Ultimate Macro v2

Roblox Ultimate Macro is a highly advanced, AutoHotkey (v2) automation tool designed for long-term AFK grinding. It goes beyond simple auto-clicking by integrating smart error detection, auto-rejoining capabilities, discord remote monitoring, and precise task scheduling.

🌟 Key Features
1. Smart Auto-Rejoin System

Uses Dual-Pixel Detection to monitor game health:

Error Check: Detects disconnect screens immediately.

Safety Check: Verifies the player is successfully loaded in-game.

If a disconnect is detected, the script automatically kills the Roblox process, re-launches the private server link, and navigates back into the game loop.

2. Discord Integration & Remote Control

Live Logs: Sends Webhook notifications when the macro starts, stops, or encounters errors.

Remote Screenshots: Sends a screenshot of your game to Discord on a custom loop (e.g., every 2 minutes) so you can check your progress from your phone.

Bot Commands: Control your PC remotely! Send !start or !stop in your Discord channel to control the macro.

3. Precision Scheduler

Set a specific Day, Hour, and Minute for the macro to automatically wake up and start grinding.

Includes an optional "Close All Apps" feature that automatically closes memory-hogging applications (like Chrome, Spotify, etc.) to free up resources for Roblox when the schedule triggers.

4. Bloxstrap Support

Automatically edits the Bloxstrap Settings.json file to disable "Confirm Launches" when the macro starts and re-enables it when stopped. This ensures the Auto-Rejoin feature never gets stuck on a popup.

🛠️ Technical Settings

Click Loop: Customizable interval for anti-AFK clicking.

Screenshot Loop: Independent timer for Discord screenshots (adjustable via Up/Down arrows).

Debug Mode: Displays on-screen tooltips to visualize exactly what part of the logic the script is executing.

GUI: A clean, dark-themed interface with Tabs for easy configuration.
